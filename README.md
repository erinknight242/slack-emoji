# slack-emoji
A collection of gifs and images to create Slack and HipChat emoji with.



## Contributing

Any appropriate image that meets Slack's current upload requirements can be added to the `emoji` folder. If there is a larger resolution "original" image, that can also be added to the `high-res` folder. If the original image *is* the high res version, there is no need to add it in both places. If you do add both images, it should have the same file name in both folders (or maybe with "large" or "full" added as a suffix on the high res) so that it is easier to find.

Any image depicting people you know should have that person's permission before adding it to the repo.

To add images, or make improvements to existing images, add an issue with your request or open a PR.

### Image Guidelines

The current recommendations for emoji in the `emoji` folder are:

- Less than 128 KB
- Square when possible
- Transparent background when possible
- Gif's less than 50 frames (new requirement of Slack)
- naming should be unique (regardless of file type) - do not upload a hello.gif if hello.png already exists; pick a different name

Since slack does change its requirements from time to time, if you notice any emoji in the `emoji` folder you want to use that now fail to upload, create an issue in this repo for it to be fixed.
